This insight could prompt further investigation into whether company maturity influences compensation strategies.\n","\n","Feature Redundancy:\n","• If two variables show near-perfect correlation, it might indicate redundancy.

It divides the total market into segments, providing a clear view of how companies are distributed across various categories such as \"Less than $1 Million,\" \"$1 Million to $10 Million,\" and so on. 2. *Visual Simplicity:* Pie charts are easy to interpret, especially when you are visualizing a limited number of categories. The use of a pie chart allows your audience to quickly grasp the relative size of each revenue bracket at a glance. 3. *Effective for Proportional Data:* Since we are interested in understanding the share of each revenue category within the dataset, the pie chart is a powerful tool for communicating proportions. The percentage labels make it clear how each revenue group contributes to the overall distribution. 4. *Storytelling with Distribution:* Using a pie chart allows you to tell a simple yet compelling story about the composition of the companies in your dataset based on their revenue. It can highlight dominant categories, or perhaps unusual distribution patterns that may prompt deeper analysis. 5. *Ease of Communication:* Pie charts are often used in business presentations because they quickly convey information without requiring the viewer to interpret complex data points.
