        "The objective of this project was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Amazon Prime TV shows and movies to understand the key trends, patterns, and potential improvements for content recommendations. The analysis was conducted using two datasets: titles.csv, which contains detailed information about movies and TV shows, and credits.csv, which includes details about the people involved in these productions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding the Dataset\n",
        "The titles.csv dataset consists of 9,871 entries with 15 columns, including title names, types (movie or show), descriptions, genres, release years, age certifications, IMDb and TMDb ratings, and popularity scores. The credits.csv dataset has 124,235 records with 5 columns, detailing actors, directors, and other contributors to each title.\n",
        "\n",
        "Initial data inspection revealed several missing values, particularly in key columns such as age_certification, seasons, imdb_score, and tmdb_score. The credits.csv dataset had some missing values in the character column, where certain actors did not have a recorded role name. Additionally, the datasets contained duplicate records, which needed to be removed for accurate analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\n",
        "To ensure data quality, several data wrangling techniques were applied:\n",
        "\n",
        "Duplicate Removal – Duplicate records in both datasets were dropped to avoid redundancy.\n",
        "Handling Missing Values – Missing values in age_certification were replaced with “Not Rated,” missing seasons were set to 0 for movies, and IMDb/TMDb scores were filled with their respective median values. Missing character names in credits.csv were replaced with “Unknown.”\n",
        "Data Type Optimization – Columns like release_year, seasons, and imdb_votes were converted to integer types, while IMDb and TMDb scores were set as floats for numerical analysis.\n",
        "Text Standardization – Title names were capitalized, genres were converted to lowercase for consistency, and production country names were cleaned for better readability.\n",
        "Key Insights from the Analysis\n",
        "After cleaning the dataset, several key insights were uncovered:\n",
        "\n",
        "A significant number of shows were missing age certifications, which could impact parental control features and audience targeting.\n",
        "IMDb and TMDb ratings had some missing values, which might affect recommendation algorithms if not handled properly.\n",
        "The seasons column was mostly empty, indicating that most titles were movies rather than TV shows.\n",
        "Popularity scores varied widely, suggesting that some titles gained significant audience traction while others remained less popular.\n",
        "Business Recommendations\n",
        "Based on the insights from the EDA, several recommendations were made to improve the content strategy for Amazon Prime:\n",
        "\n",
        "Enhancing Content Recommendations – By utilizing IMDb and TMDb ratings, the platform can prioritize highly-rated shows and movies in user recommendations.\n",
        "Filling Metadata Gaps – Missing values in key columns like age certifications and ratings should be cross-referenced with external databases to improve data completeness.\n",
        "Targeted Marketing Based on Popularity – High tmdb_popularity scores indicate which titles attract more viewers. These should be highlighted in promotional banners and featured sections.\n",
        "Regional Content Optimization – Analyzing production_countries and age_certification can help curate region-specific recommendations, improving audience engagement.\n",
        "Better Differentiation Between TV Shows and Movies – Using the seasons column to correctly classify content will enhance search filters and user experience."
